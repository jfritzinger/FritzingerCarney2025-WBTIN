UR EAR - University of Rochester Envisioning Auditory Responses (Version 2022a) 

Getting Started
---------------

UR_EAR is a MATLAB code package created to study and explore various auditory
models and stimuli. This code has the Zilany 2014 Auditory Nerve (AN) model
and the Bruce et al. (2018) AN model [See bottom of this file for details
regarding the Bruce et al model]. An inferior colliculus (IC) Modulation
Filter model (Mao et al 2013), and the Same-Frequency Inhibition and
Excitation (SFIE) model (Nelson and Carney 2004; Carney et al., 2015) are 
included, as well as some classic auditory stimuli. Through a graphical user 
interface (GUI), the user can select a model, a stimulus, and select a variety 
of parameters, and then run the code. The output consists of a series of 
plots such as the waveform, spectrum, and model responses.

It is possible to edit the code to add in your own stimuli and/or models.
More detailed instructions lie in the code itself and in the user manual.

See below for instructions for installation and running initially. Refer to
the user manual, manual_UR_EAR_2020a.pdf for more detailed information and
instructions.

Install
-------
To install the UR_EAR code package, download the zip file from the website,
and unzip. Save the folder, and then open it and add it to your path in MATLAB.

This code has been tested on Windows 10, macOS, and Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

(Note: run testANModel.m for a quick check that your installation is OK.)

To Run
------
Open the code package in MATLAB, and add only the main folder to your path.  
It is important not to add to your path any of the subfolders, especially 
+stimuli and private.  Type UR_EAR_2022a to run it. A GUI will open, 
and you will be able to make your selections.

Built With
----------
This code was originally created in MATLAB R2015b, and updated using Matlab R2021a. 
You will need MATLAB R2018b or later to run this code.

-------
This is UR_EAR_2022a, Version 2022a (April 2022).

This code ALSO includes the BEZ2018 version of the code for the auditory-periphery 
model from the Bruce lab at McMaster University.

This release implements the version of the model described in:

	model of the synapse between the inner hair cell and auditory nerve: 
	Implications of limited neurotransmitter release sites," to appear in

this code or any modified versions of this code.


*** Instructions ***

The Matlab and C code included with this distribution is designed to be
compiled as a Matlab MEX file, i.e., the compiled model MEX function will run
as if it were a Matlab function.  The code can be compiled within Matlab using
the function:

    mexANmodel.m

Note that it is also possible to compile and run the code in the open-source
(i.e, free!) software Octave just as it is done in Matlab, although it will
typically run more slowly in Octave.  It may be necessary to install the
"signal" and "control" packages within Octave before running the AN model code.

The code is implemented in two parts. The first function, model_IHC_BEZ2018,
takes the acoustic signal as input and gives the IHC's relative transmembrane
potential (Vihc) as the output.  The second function, model_Synapse_BEZ2018,
takes Vihc as input and outputs the PSTH (or a spike train for a single stimulus
presentation).  There are also a number of additional optional outputs from
this second function - see the help information for further details. For
instructions on how to run the code, the following commands can be run at
the Matlab command prompt:

    help model_IHC_BEZ2018

    help model_Synapse_BEZ2018

We have also included:-

1. a Matlab function "generateANpopulation.m" for generating a population
   of AN fibers with the statistics for spont rate and absolute & relative
   refractory periods as described in the journal article,

2. a function "fitaudiogram2.m" for estimating the parameters for outer and
   inner hair cell impairment, Cohc and Cihc, respectively, for a given
   audiogram, and

3. a number of scripts with filenames beginning with "test..." that run
   simulations and generate figures similar to a subset of those from the
   journal article and supplementary material.

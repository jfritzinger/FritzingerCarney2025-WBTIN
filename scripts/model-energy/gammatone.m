%this is the function to get gammatone filter

% To use this function, you needn't set the Fs very high(because
% it is bilinear, so just above 2*band is enough and then you may
% need to upsampling the result if you  want to pass the result
% through the synapse ( the synapse dynamics need high sampling rate
%
%Using bilinear transform/Impinvar transform !!!
